That's when he told the Dems that he'd fire about half the agriculture department's employees at headquarters in order to hire "people to put in the field because that's where we need it. Because right now we have so little people in the field, the HEBs of this state, the Brookshires of this state, they're calibrating their own gas pumps. The TDA just sends them the stickers and they calibrate them. So we literally do have the fox guarding the hen house. That's got to stop."

Leibowitz said Gilbert meant "independent inspector" stickers--again, not the same as state stickers--which he said Gilbert has seen on Brookshire pumps in East Texas.

Hank misspoke." Asked if Gilbert subsequently issued a correction or retraction, Leibowitz replied by e-mail that "someone approached him after this to talk to him about it, and he clarified what he intended to say. He has since not similarly misspoken and has talked about gas pumps dozens and dozens of times on the stump."

Leibowitz said Gilbert foresees eliminating various agency positions and using the savings to hire more field inspectors, but that it's "inappropriate and premature" to detail those plans.

Both told us they contract the calibration of their pumps to outside vendors.

If we are not compliant, we have to have our service provider come back out to fix them. Then the department comes back out." In a follow-up e-mail, Anderson said the grocery store does not have its own certification stickers on its approximately 400 dispensers.

But Gilbert leaves the impression this practice is new and nefarious -- and a substitute for state inspections. It's not. Also, as Gilbert's campaign acknowledged to us, his statement that the state sends stickers to stores simply isn't so.

Regardless, his claim--which was never corrected publicly--incorrectly suggests wrongdoing, and state complicity in that wrongdoing. On the Truth-O-Meter, that's fuel enough to rate False.

A granite monument stands at the intersection of Texas 214 and Texas 83 in memorial but the report’s author Jack McDonald said a better memorial might be doing more to prevent H2S deaths, particularly when it comes to worker training.

Responding to our query, Gilbert's campaign manager, Vince Leibowitz, said in an e-mail that both HEB and Brookshire independently have their gas pumps certified between state inspections.
Per Gilbert's statement that the agriculture department "sends them the stickers," Leibowitz said Gilbert wasn't referring to the state inspection seals, which he said can only be affixed by agency employees. Leibowitz said Gilbert meant "independent inspector" stickers--again, not the same as state stickers--which he said Gilbert has seen on Brookshire pumps in East Texas.
Stores do indeed calibrate their gas pumps--by using state-certified technicians. But Gilbert leaves the impression this practice is new and nefarious -- and a substitute for state inspections. It's not. Also, as Gilbert's campaign acknowledged to us, his statement that the state sends stickers to stores simply isn't so.
But today's venture into the state's vast span o' pumps was touched off by an Aug. 20 press release from Staples' campaign bringing to light a video of Gilbert at the Central Texas Democratic Forum on Jan. 11--yes, January. That's when he told the Dems that he'd fire about half the agriculture department's employees at headquarters in order to hire "people to put in the field because that's where we need it. Because right now we have so little people in the field, the HEBs of this state, the Brookshires of this state, they're calibrating their own gas pumps. The TDA just sends them the stickers and they calibrate them. So we literally do have the fox guarding the hen house. That's got to stop."
Next, we queried HEB and Brookshire about their gas pumps. Both told us they contract the calibration of their pumps to outside vendors.
Explained Sam Anderson, spokesman for the Tyler-based Brookshire Grocery Company: "If they pass (state) inspection, the Department of Agriculture provides their stickers. If we are not compliant, we have to have our service provider come back out to fix them. Then the department comes back out." In a follow-up e-mail, Anderson said the grocery store does not have its own certification stickers on its approximately 400 dispensers.
Hank Gilbert campaign, transcript of Gilbert's remarks on gas pump inspections, Austin, Jan. 11, 2010
Hot on this sticker trail, we checked with the Texas Department of Agriculture whose spokesman, Bryan Black, said its inspectors are the only personnel authorized to inspect a fuel pump and apply its "weights and measure seal. That is the law and that is our policy."
Hank Gilbert, the Democratic nominee for state agriculture commissioner, has hammered incumbent Todd Staples, a Republican, on many fronts, including his agency's performance inspecting gas pumps to make sure they work right.
PolitiFact Texas just checked his September claim that pumps in each of the state's five Texas Department of Agriculture regions lack required state stickers or have stickers that are out of date. We rated that statement Half True.
A TDA Web page says the department has 72 weights and measures inspectors throughout the state checking more than 65,000 fuel pumps a year. Leibowitz said Gilbert foresees eliminating various agency positions and using the savings to hire more field inspectors, but that it's "inappropriate and premature" to detail those plans.
However, Leibowitz said, "to our knowledge, TDA does not send out those stickers. Hank misspoke." Asked if Gilbert subsequently issued a correction or retraction, Leibowitz replied by e-mail that "someone approached him after this to talk to him about it, and he clarified what he intended to say. He has since not similarly misspoken and has talked about gas pumps dozens and dozens of times on the stump."
We wondered how such a dramatic statement had slipped past us. Has anyone else noticed that the state sends stickers to stores that calibrate their own pumps? Are things that cozy?
Stores of all sizes must calibrate their pumps by using registered service technicians, licensed by the TDA, Black said. State law requires each pump to be insp

I don’t know if McCain was deliberately trying to mislead or whether he just has amnesia. But this is as honking an example of AIG bailout revisionism as I have seen attempted by Washington’s enablers. And it’s turning me green with nausea for St. Patty’s Day.

The bailout was an effort of last resort, meant to save AIG from being forced to declare bankruptcy — which would have made it the biggest bankruptcy of all time, with major reverberations across the economy considering its trillion-dollar balance sheet and global ties across numerous industries. Earlier in the day yesterday, when a loan package failed to emerge, the market dropped just contemplating the possibility of an AIG bankruptcy. Last night on CNN, Campbell Brown introduced the news saying, "This affects almost everyone out there who has a 401K." An AIG bankruptcy would have been a very, very big deal.

Yesterday morning, McCain sat for an interview with Matt Lauer that was notable first and foremost for the strangeness of his demeanor: Wooden, sullen, and repeating the same talking points over and over again. Lauer asked all the right questions, but failed to elicit more from McCain than repeated exhortations against "fat cats" and "Beltway insiders." At one point, McCain was almost hostile to Lauer when he pressed him on the "fundamentals" issue ("There's nothing wrong with the workers of America. I believed that they're the fundamentals. You may not, others may not").

They need something in the neighborhood of 75 billion dollars to become secure again. What should the government do? First of all, do we even have that kind of money in the system?

And I'm glad that Secretary Paulson has apparently taken the same line.

That was yesterday morning in the 7 a.m. hour. Cut to twelve hours later, and the feds did the exact opposite. Why? Because of those 401Ks, because of the interdependence of the economy with AIG's vast web of interests, because, to paraphrase CNN's Ali Velshi last night, the economy could take losing an investment bank but AIG, not so much.

This should worry Americans, for obvious reasons — not only because of what McCain clearly failed to grasp about the situation, but because he didn't seem even really to try. In the middle of the worst financial crisis in years, he was surly, wooden, and uncooperative as an interviewer asked legitimate questions — precisely when it was most important to be forthcoming.

While McCain's testiness yesterday morning was well-noted, his glib assertion regarding AIG didn't get traction in the news cycle until today, when he reversed himself somewhat (see here and here; I didn't see this moment highlighted on "NBC Nightly News" or on MSNBC's post-AIG announcement coverage, though I may have missed it). But to my mind, it was the most important and revealing moment of the interview, because it revealed that McCain had little to no understanding of the issue. Even his statement today on "Good Morning America" — "There are literally millions of people whose retirement, whose investment, whose insurance were at risk here" — was not even hinted at in his Today show comments.

McCain's answer yesterday on AIG was not an accident. Put bluntly, I can't see any evidence that he knew what he was talking about; nor any evidence that he wanted to try. This is a blatant moment, on tape, under urgent questioning from the media at a moment of crisis, and not only was his lack of preparation apparent but his attitude spoke volumes. This isn't a matter of left or right, of "gotcha" or "in the tank" or anything else — it's a matter of accountability at a pretty critical moment. It should be noted, and remembered.

A day after he dismissed a federal bailout for American International Group, Republican John McCain announced Wednesday that circumstances had forced him to shift his position and that he supported the proposed $85 billion rescue of the insurance giant.
McCain, who in recent days has slammed what he called Wall Street greed and corruption for causing the latest downward spiral of the stock market, said he had to change his position on AIG to protect millions of Americans who could be hurt if the company was forced to seek bankruptcy protection.
âThe focus of any such action should be to protect the millions of Americans who hold insurance policies, retirement plans and other accounts with AIG,â he said. âWe must not bail out the management and speculators who created this mess.â
On September 18, 2008, McCain caved in to the Chicken Little climate in Washington and reversed his position on the $85 billion AIG bailout (that came on the heels of McCain joining hands with Obama to support a $25 billion bailout for the automakers):
“voted for first tarp but that doesn’t mean i voted to bail out AIG.”
âThe government was forced to commit $85 billion,â McCain said in a statement. âThese actions stem from failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street that has crippled one of the most important companies in America.
“i voted for first tarp but that doesn’t mean i voted to bail out AIG.”
But that’s exactly what the first bailout infusion did. And McCain went along, as did all the other AIG enablers now pounding their fists on TV, in Twitter-land, and everywhere else.
“i would have never bailed out AIG, the real scandal is billions to foreign banks.”
“If we hadn’t bailed out AIG = no bonuses for greedy execs.”
I don’t know if McCain was deliberately trying to mislead or whether he just has amnesia. But this is as honking an example of AIG bailout revisionism as I have seen attempted by Washington’s enablers. And it’s turning me green with nausea for St. Patty’s Day.
“RIght, but didn’t you vote for first TARP, which went to AIG?”
Now, he’s against bailout out failing companies in the first place.
Preceding the interview, Sen. McCain wrote this on his Twitter page:
George Stephanopoulos of ABC News just wrapped up a Twitter interview with John McCain.
Stephanopoulous was more concerned with McCain’s daughter’s spats than with nailing McCain on his AIG flip-flopping. What a wasted opportunity. (Or as we say in Twitter-world: #fail.)
During the “Twitterview” with Stephanopoulous this morning, he wrote this:
And then he quickly followed up:
We’ll see how long that lasts…

McCAIN: The government should not — of course, this is one of the outstanding and glaring examples of the terrible problems and corruption and greed and excess that has caused all of this fallout — which is going to harm the average American worker...no, I do not believe that the American taxpayer should be on the hook for AIG. And I'm glad that Secretary Paulson has apparently taken the same line.
But Lauer was able to break through a bit on AIG, pinning McCain down on whether he thought the Feds should bail out the insurance giant, even if McCain gave no indication as to why:
McCAIN: Well...quote, "on their own"...we have to - we cannot have the taxpayers bail out AIG or anybody else...this is something we're gonna have to work through — there's too much corruption, there's too much access, we can fix it, I believe in America - we can have a 9/11 commission such as we had after 9/11, 'cause this is a huge crisis and we can come up with fixes and we can make sure that every American has a safer future and that is to make them know that their bank deposits are safe and insured.

However, there are also statements from McCain indicating that he voted for the first TARP but did not vote to bail out AIG specifically.

Republican presidential candidate John McCain, struggling to strike the right note amid roiling financial markets and a Wall Street restructuring, on Wednesday softened his opposition to a bailout of mega-insurer AIG that he had flatly ruled out a day earlier.
On Wednesday, McCain repeated that he didn't want to bail out AIG and knew of no one else who did. But, he said millions of people with retirement, investments and insurance tied to AIG were "going to have their lives destroyed because of the greed and excess and corruption."
Before the Treasury Department proposed an $85 billion loan to keep afloat American International Group Inc., the country's largest corporate insurer, McCain said he wouldn't support any bailout for AIG or any other company. "This is something that we're going to have to work through," he said Tuesday. "There's too much corruption, there's too much excess."
In two new television ads Wednesday, McCain asserts that he is the right leader to keep Americans' savings safe.
"Enough is enough," McCain says in one of the commercials. "I'll meet this financial crisis head on. Reform Wall Street. New rules for fairness and honesty. I won't tolerate a system that puts you and your family at risk. Your savings, your jobs — I'll keep them safe."
Asked for specific examples of corruption regarding AIG, senior McCain campaign adviser Steve Schmidt offered none.
Elaborating on the charge of corruption, McCain said that many Wall Street executives had claimed "everything's fine, not to worry" and that Congress and regulators had paid no attention. "All of them were asleep at the switch," he said, and went on to blame special interests and lobbyists as well.
In the interview, McCain called the financial crisis "one of the most severe crises in modern times," yet on Monday morning he had maintained his oft-stated position that "the fundamentals of our economy are strong." For that he drew withering criticism from his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, and others. By afternoon, with the markets falling amid other bad financial news, McCain was using a more dire tone.
McCain repeated his call for a high-level commission, on the order of the one that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks, to review the economic troubles on Wall Street. But when asked by ABC for examples of what he would do to deal with the current problems, McCain cited only the proposals he offered well before the crisis emerged — no tax increases, affordable health care and energy alternatives among them.

In a second ad, McCain criticizes Obama as offering only "talk and taxes" as solutions. Obama himself taped a two-minute commercial Tuesday in Colorado in which he speaks directly to American voters about the country's economic problems.
The early morning release of McCain's ads and their rapid production — one was taped during a 10-minute stop at a home in Tampa, Fla., on Tuesday — highlight his efforts to reclaim the high ground on a subject he has acknowledged is a weakness.
"Well, at this hour, when you look at the situation, it is still muddled and unclear," Schmidt told The Associated Press. "But it is clear that the system has been corrupted, that there has been systemic failures, that the economy has been damaged by greed and avarice, and the broken institutions between Washington and New York have now conspired in a way that has put the American economy in crisis."

McCain was adamant in an interview with "The Today Show." "No, I do not believe that the American taxpayer should be on the hook for AIG, and I'm glad that the Secretary [Henry] Paulson has apparently taken the same line."

In a speech on immigration reform in El Paso, Texas, President Barack Obama boasted about an unprecedented number of border security agents along the U.S. border with Mexico, but he said critics probably still won't be satisfied.

"Under Secretary Napolitano’s leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible," Obama said in his May 10, 2011, speech. "They wanted more agents on the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents –- more than twice as many as there were in 2004, a buildup that began under President Bush and that we have continued."

"I suspect there will be those who will try to move the goal posts one more time," Obama said. "They’ll say we need to triple the border patrol. Or quadruple the border patrol."

Obama has touted this statistic about border patrol agents in his immigration speeches before. In July 2010, we fact-checked the president's claim that "Today, we have more boots on the ground near the southwest border than at any time in our history." (the same phrase he used in El Paso). And last month, our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia checked Obama's claim in a TV interview that "We have now more Border Patrol officers … than we’ve had at any time in our history."

We rated both of those claims Mostly True, noting that while border patrol manpower is at an all-time modern high, President Woodrow Wilson sent between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in 1916 to quell a surprise attack in the New Mexico town of Columbus by Pancho Villa, a military venture otherwise known as the Mexican Expedition of 1916.

According to a March 3, 2010, analysis of border security by the Congressional Research Service, "Border Patrol agent manpower assigned to the southwest border has been increasing steadily since the early 1990s. In 1992, there were 3,555 agents assigned to the southern border, by 2000 that number had increased by 141 percent to 8,580. Since 2000, the number of agents assigned to the southern border has continued to increase, more than doubling once more to 20,119 agents at the end of FY2009. The rapid and steady increase of Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border reflects the ongoing interest in Congress in stemming the tide of illegal immigration."

The report notes that Obama's proposed 2011 budget requested a reduction of 181 Border Patrol agents. But the administration's proposed 2012 budget calls for increasing the the number of border patrol agents to 21,370.

Jack Martin, special projects director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter illegal immigration guidelines, said Obama's statistic is true but that much of the credit for starting the trend toward more border security goes to Obama's predecessor.

"There has been a steady buildup of BP officers for several years given impetus by the 9/11 attacks," Martin said. "The increase has by necessity been gradual because it is limited by the capacity of the BP training facility."

The report confirmed that personnel and other resources to stop illegal crossings of the U.S.-Mexico border have increased dramatically in recent years. In 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was created, reorganizing several federal agencies under a single roof. That year, the agency had 10,500 agents to patrol land borders. That number now stands at nearly 21,000.

In other words, manpower has roughly doubled since 2004, as Obama said in his speech in El Paso. Again, that trend began under President Bush, whom Obama credited, but it continued under Obama. We rate Obama's statement True.

Obama "has cracked down employers -- on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president."

The Secure Fence Act of 2006, passed by a Republican-led Congress and was signed by Bush. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico and called for adding unmanned aerial vehicles, satellites, radar and cameras. The fenced segments totaled roughly 650-700 miles, while the entire U.S.-Mexican border is about 2,000 miles long. Obama, an Illinois senator at the time, voted for the law.

The act specified "at least two layers of reinforced fencing," but in 2007 the law was altered to give the Border Patrol leeway to decide the type of fencing. By the time Obama became president in January 2009, much of the fence was completed -- but not of the type originally planned.

A preliminary analysis of border miles under control showed 15 percent were "controlled" while the rest were "managed" and left vulnerabilities to illegal activity.

For this fact-check, Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman sent us a 2011 White House immigration report that stated "DHS has also completed 649 miles of fencing out of nearly 652 miles planned, including 299 miles of vehicle barriers and 350 miles of pedestrian fence, with the remaining 3 miles scheduled to be completed."

Separately, an additional 1,200 National Guard troops were authorized for the the border.

Fencing isn’t the only way the federal government has attempted to manage the border. The Secure Border Initiative launched in 2005 with the intention to combine fencing with technological tools such as cameras, sensors and radar, according to a paper from the Migration Policy Institute. Boeing won a contract and received about $860 million from the federal government.

Under Obama, border apprehensions have fallen from their high points. Border apprehensions peaked at almost 1.7 million in 2000 under President Clinton, and apprehensions in 2011 were at the lowest level since 1970. The post-2008 declines are due to the recession and loss of jobs which had attracted unauthorized immigrants. Net illegal immigration from Mexico has fallen to zero or even fewer coming than leaving.

"Whether that equates to ‘border security’ is another question. As to who should get more credit for border security, the fence was a bipartisan project."

She is correct that the highest number of border patrol agents has been under Obama: there were 21,444 in 2011. Wasserman Schultz was careful here and said "most" and didn’t talk about the growth rate. But it’s worth noting that the big growth was during Bush’s tenure: between 2001 and 2009, the number of agents posted nationally rose from about 9,800 to a little more than 20,000.

Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact that it now has roughly 20,000 Border Patrol agents. It didn’t specify how many were at the southwest border, but historical data shows that the vast majority are sent to the southwest border.

The Border Patrol remains understaffed, despite the increased hires. It struggles to retain agents who see a lack of mobility and better opportunities elsewhere, according to a 2018 federal report.

Here, we decided to focus on Obama's claim that "the Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004."
That's up from 17,499 border patrol agents at the end of September 2008, four months before Obama took office (an 18 percent increase).
"Under Secretary Napolitano’s leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible," Obama said in his May 10, 2011, speech. "They wanted more agents on the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents –- more than twice as many as there were in 2004, a buildup that began under President Bush and that we have continued."
The report notes that Obama's proposed 2011 budget requested a reduction of 181 Border Patrol agents. But the administration's proposed 2012 budget calls for increasing the the number of border patrol agents to 21,370.
Obama has touted this statistic about border patrol agents in his immigration speeches before. In July 2010, we fact-checked the president's claim that "Today, we have more boots on the ground near the southwest border than at any time in our history." (the same phrase he used in El Paso). And last month, our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia checked Obama's claim in a TV interview that "We have now more Border Patrol officers … than we’ve had at any time in our history."
Singling out just the border patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border, the number has increased from 15,422 to 17,659 (a 14 percent increase).
There were 20,745 border patrol agents as of April 9, 2011; 17,659 of them stationed along the southwest border with Mexico, according to data provided by Steven Cribby, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security.
In a speech on immigration reform in El Paso, Texas, President Barack Obama boasted about an unprecedented number of border security agents along the U.S. border with Mexico, but he said critics probably still won't be satisfied.
According to a March 3, 2010, analysis of border security by the Congressional Research Service, "Border Patrol agent manpower assigned to the southwest border has been increasing steadily since the early 1990s. In 1992, there were 3,555 agents assigned to the southern border, by 2000 that number had increased by 141 percent to 8,580. Since 2000, the number of agents assigned to the southern border has continued to increase, more than doubling once more to 20,119 agents at the end of FY2009. The rapid and steady increase of Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border reflects the ongoing interest in Congress in stemming the tide of illegal immigration."
"I suspect there will be those who will try to move the goal posts one more time," Obama said. "They’ll say we need to triple the border patrol. Or quadruple the border patrol."
The report confirmed that personnel and other resources to stop illegal crossings of the U.S.-Mexico border have increased dramatically in recent years. In 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was created, reorganizing several federal agencies under a single roof. That year, the agency had 10,500 agents to patrol land borders. That number now stands at nearly 21,000.
In other words, manpower has roughly doubled since 2004, as Obama said in his speech in El Paso. Again, that trend began under President Bush, whom Obama credited, but it continued under Obama. We rate Obama's statement True.
Congressional Research Service, Border Security: The Role of the U.S. Border Patrol, March 3, 2010
We rated both of those claims Mostly True, noting that while border patrol manpower is at an all-time modern high, President Woodrow Wilson sent between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in 1916 to quell a surprise attack in the New Mexico town of Columbus by Pancho Villa, a military venture otherwise known as the Mexican Expedition of 1916.

2023-10-18 10:24:14,494 - Explanation: The provided web search results include multiple sources that confirm the claim made by Barack Obama. The sources state that the number of Border Patrol agents has increased from 15,422 to 17,659, and then to 20,745 as of April 9, 2011. This increase in agents is consistent with Obama's claim that there are "more than twice as many" agents as there were in 2004. The information also mentions that the increase in agents began under President Bush and continued under Obama. Therefore, there is enough evidence to determine that the claim is true.
